# Diamond Castle Game

## Description
Diamond Castle is an interactive platformer game built with JavaFX. 
The player must collect all diamonds scattered across the screen 
within 25 seconds by jumping on moving platforms. The game features 
smooth animations, collision detection, and double jump mechanics.

## Features
- **Player Movement:** Left/Right arrow keys to move
- **Jumping:** Space bar to jump (with double jump ability)
- **Platforms:** Continuously moving platforms that respawn
- **Diamonds:** Collectible items scattered across the screen
- **Timer:** 25-second countdown to collect all diamonds
- **Collision Detection:** Platform collision and diamond collection
- **Graphics:** Custom player, platform, and diamond images
- **Background Animation:** Scrolling background for visual effect

## Game Mechanics
- **Controls:**
  - LEFT Arrow: Move left
  - RIGHT Arrow: Move right
  - SPACE: Jump (can jump twice when on platform or moving)
  
- **Objective:** Collect all diamonds before time runs out

- **Double Jump:** Player can perform a double jump when on a platform

- **Platform Movement:** Platforms move upward and respawn at the bottom

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** Java
- **Framework:** JavaFX
- **Concepts:** Object-oriented programming, game loops, collision detection
- **Tools:** IDE (NetBeans/IntelliJ), Git

## How to Run
1. Ensure Java 11+ and JavaFX are installed
2. Clone this repository
3. Import the project into your IDE
4. Add JavaFX library to project dependencies
5. Place image files (player.png, platform.png, diamond.png, BackGround.png) in the project root
6. Run DiamondCastle.java

## Game Images Required
- `player.png` - Player character (50x50 pixels)
- `platform.png` - Platform image (100x10 pixels)
